## 4. Pallet Errors
The events we defined previously indicate when calls to the pallet have completed successfully. Similarly, errors indicate when a call has failed, and why it has failed.

The first of these errors can occur when attempting to claim a new proof. Of course a user cannot claim a proof that has already been claimed. The latter two can occur when attempting to revoke a proof.

To implement this, replace the #[pallet::error] line with:
```rust
pallet/template/src/lib.rs
```
```rust
    #[pallet::error]
    pub enum Error<T> {
            /// The proof has already been claimed.
            ProofAlreadyClaimed,
            /// The proof does not exist, so it cannot be revoked.
            NoSuchProof,
            /// The proof is claimed by another account, so caller can't revoke it.
            NotProofOwner,
        }
```
## 5. Pallet Storage
To add a new proof to the blockchain, we will simply store that proof in our pallet's storage. To store that value, we will create a hash map from the proof to the owner of that proof and the block number the proof was made. We'll be using FRAME's StorageMap to keep track of this information.

To implement this, replace the #[pallet::storage] line with:
```rust
pallet/template/src/lib.rs
```
```rust
    #[pallet::storage] 
    pub(super) type Proofs<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Blake2_128Concat, Vec<u8>, (T::AccountId, T::BlockNumber), ValueQuery>;   
```
## Pallet Callable Functions
As implied by our pallet's events and errors, we will have two "dispatchable functions" the user can call in this FRAME pallet:

create_claim()：允许用户通过上传文件摘要来声明存在一个文件。
revoke_claim()：允许存证的拥有人撤销他们的拥有权。
These functions will be based on using the StorageMap based on the following logic: if a proof has an owner and a block number, then we know that it has been claimed. Otherwise, the proof is available to be claimed (and written to storage).

To implement this, replace the #[pallet::call] line with:
```rust
pallet/template/src/lib.rs
```
```rust
    // Dispatchable functions allows users to interact with the pallet and invoke state changes.
    // These functions materialize as "extrinsics", which are often compared to transactions.
    // Dispatchable functions must be annotated with a weight and must return a DispatchResult.
        #[pallet::call]
        impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
            #[pallet::weight(1_000)]
            pub fn create_claim(
                origin: OriginFor<T>,
                proof: Vec<u8>,
            ) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {

                // Check that the extrinsic was signed and get the signer.
                // This function will return an error if the extrinsic is not signed.
                // https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/origin
                let sender = ensure_signed(origin)?;

                // Verify that the specified proof has not already been claimed.         
                ensure!(!Proofs::<T>::contains_key(&proof), Error::<T>::ProofAlreadyClaimed);

                // Get the block number from the FRAME System module.
                let current_block = <frame_system::Pallet<T>>::block_number();

                // Store the proof with the sender and block number.
                Proofs::<T>::insert(&proof, (&sender, current_block));

                // Emit an event that the claim was created.
                Self::deposit_event(Event::ClaimCreated(sender, proof));

                Ok(().into())
            }

            #[pallet::weight(10_000)]
            pub fn revoke_claim(
                origin: OriginFor<T>,
                proof: Vec<u8>,
            ) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
                // Check that the extrinsic was signed and get the signer.
                // This function will return an error if the extrinsic is not signed.
                // https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/origin
                let sender = ensure_signed(origin)?;

                // Verify that the specified proof has been claimed.
                ensure!(Proofs::<T>::contains_key(&proof), Error::<T>::NoSuchProof);

                // Get owner of the claim.
                let (owner, _) = Proofs::<T>::get(&proof);

                // Verify that sender of the current call is the claim owner.
                ensure!(sender == owner, Error::<T>::NotProofOwner);

                // Remove claim from storage.
                Proofs::<T>::remove(&proof);

                // Emit an event that the claim was erased.
                Self::deposit_event(Event::ClaimRevoked(sender, proof));

                Ok(().into())
            }
        }
```
## Build Your New Pallet
After you've copied all of the parts of this pallet correctly into your pallets/template/lib.rs file, you should be able to recompile your node without warning or error. Run this command in the root directory of the substrate-node-template repository to build and run the node:
```rust
# Compile your node
cargo build --release
# Launch your chain in dev mode
./target/release/node-template --dev --tmp
```
