### Blockchain basics
Blockchain: a decentralized ledger that records information in a sequence of blocks.

Nodes: 
- Individual computers. 
- Communicate with each other to form a decentralized peer-to-peer network.
- Logic for ordering and processing incoming transactions.
- Data storage for the state changes recorded as a result of transactions.
- Consensus methodology to protect against malicious activity and ensure the ongoing progress of the chain.
- Cryptography for generating hash digests for blocks and for signing and verifying the signatures associated with transactions.

Consensus: you can agree on the state of the data in each block and on the order of transactions executed.
