### Why Substrate?
Substrate might be the perfect choice if you want to build a blockchain that is:
- tailored to a very specific use case
- able to connect and communicate with other blockchains
- customizable with predefined composable modular components
- able to evolve and change with upgrades over time

Substrate is:
- Flexible:

Substrate is a fully modular blockchain framework that lets you compose a chain with explicitly decoupled componnets, by selecting the network stack, consensus model, or governance method that suits your project or by creating your own components.

- Open

open source

- Interoperable

All Substrate-based blockchains can interoperate with the other blockchains through Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM). Substrate can be used to create chains as independent networks (solo chains), or tightly coupled to a relay chain to share its security as a parachain.

- Future-proof (forkless upgrades because of WebAssemly)
