### State transitions and storage
**Cryptographic hashing algorithms**
Hard to manipulate. Even number 1 in cryptographic hashing algorithms will be very long and complicated. (Blake2 128 Concat)
**Transparent hashing algorithms**
Easy to discover and verify the input that was used to generate a given output. (Blake2 128 Concat, TwoX 64 Concat)
